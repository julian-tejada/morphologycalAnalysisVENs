# Figure 1. Most important variables found in human and information driven variable selection. The median ranking is represented by the x values and the numbers assigned to each point. A lower value indicates a higher importance of the variable. For example, the most important variables for all machine learning classifiers were average length and number of stems, but this level of agreement was not observed between the human experts, for whom the variable with the best average ranking was total number of trees, which appeared in seventh place for the machine learning classifiers. The interrater variability between experts' response was low (Fleiss' Kappa for m Raters; number of variables = 19, experts = 7, Kappa = 0.0132, z = 1.12, p = 0.262).

# Figure 2. Most important variables considering the classification algorithm. The importance of variables is represented by their median ranked order (x values and point numbers), where lower values indicate higher importance. Across all machine learning classifiers, average length emerged as the most significant variable. Specifically, it held the top spot in importance for C50, Earth, and XGBoost, and was the second most important variable for SVM.
